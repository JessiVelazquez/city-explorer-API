03-23-2021 8:40pm - Server is running and is serving static data to city-explorer front end
03-24-2021 11:24pm - Server is running locally and serving weather API data to front end upon request. Server is deploed to heroku but there is an issue with it not sending API data to front end. Currently for the app to work, nodemon must be run locally.
03-25-2021 11:24pm - Server code has been refactored into function module file and main server.js file. Server is still running locally and serving weather API data to front end upon request. Server is deployed to heroku but there remains to be an issue with it not sending API data to front end. Currently for the app to work, nodemon must be run locally.
