## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
03-23-2021 8:40pm - Server is running and is serving static data to city-explorer front end
03-24-2021 11:24pm - Server is running locally and serving weather API data to front end upon request. Server is deploed to heroku but there is an issue with it not sending API data to front end. Currently for the app to work, nodemon must be run locally.
